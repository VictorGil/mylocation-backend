# MyLocation backend application

Java application based on [Vert.x](https://vertx.io/) which receives live location updates from [mylocation-android](https://github.com/VictorGil/mylocation-android) and then sends the location data to [mylocation-frontend](https://github.com/VictorGil/mylocation-frontend) using the [SockJS event bus bridge](https://vertx.io/docs/vertx-web/java/#_sockjs_event_bus_bridge).
